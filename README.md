# enumerablejs 

## REPOSITORY WILL BE ARCHIVED 03/01/2023

Due to the nature of this repository and my interest in it, I am officially archiving it. It was a good learning project a long time ago, that no longer gets any attention and needs to be sunset. To those of you who downloaded this code and used it, thank you for your support. :)

### yarn
```bash
## install with yarn
$ yarn add asenumerable
```

### npm
```bash
## install with npm
$ npm install asenumerable
```

## Known Issues

In v1.3.0 require this module in node by using the following:

``` javascript
var Enumerable = require('asenumerable/dist/enumerable');
```
